Plane crash produces simple SVG documents based on input parameters for a burndown.

Dependencies
------------
sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install scruffy


Running
-------
To start:

ruby plane_crash


Generation
----------

Visit /bd (burdown) with following parameters on a GET:

start_date=DD-MM-YY, e.g. 1-1-09
end_date=DD-MM-YY, e.g. 15-1-09
tp = total points for iteraton, e.g. 100
dDD-MM-YY=points scored on day, e.g. d13-1-09=12

You may make as many parameters of the d type as you wish to indicate point scoring on the day. Obviously it's a bit onerous to build URLs this way, but form input or link generation from Redmine is not far off.

A sample URL to get started:

http://localhost:4567/bd?start_date=1-1-09&end_date=15-1-09&tp=100&d3-1-09=10&d5-1-09=30&d13-1-09=12


Have fun!
