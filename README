Plane crash produces PNGs based on input parameters for a burndown. 

Dependencies
------------
sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install gruff

Running
-------
To start:

ruby plane_crash

(make sure you have created a public directory for the PNGs)

Example Graphs
--------------
See the examples directory

Generation
----------

Visit /bd with the following parameters on a GET:

start_date=DD-MM-YY, e.g. 1-1-09
end_date=DD-MM-YY, e.g. 15-1-09
tp = total points for iteraton, e.g. 100
dDD-MM-YY=points scored on day, e.g. d13-1-09=12

You may make as many parameters of the d type as you wish to indicate point scoring to represent days in the spring (only one d entry per day, holding the day total). Obviously it's a bit onerous to build URLs this way, but form input or link generation from Redmine is not far off.

A sample URL to get started:

http://localhost:4567/bd?start_date=1-1-09&end_date=15-1-09&tp=100&d3-1-09=10&d5-1-09=30&d13-1-09=12

This is the result of about 4 hours of hacking about with sinatra and scruffy for the first time. Hopefully it will improve. Scruffy is being a bit difficult with some of the vertical numbers ... will have to play with it. Contributions welcome.

Have fun!

Feedback
--------
If you run plane_crash or have any suggestions for it please let me know.

I have been thinking about setting up some integration rules for various projects (e.g. a task which can integrate with Redmine/Unfuddle, XYZ Project tracker, and generate burndowns based on certain rules and email them on a daily basis).
